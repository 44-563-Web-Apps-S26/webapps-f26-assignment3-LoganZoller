            My favorite place to visit is Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City. 
            It is where the Kansas City Chiefs play. 
            The reason it is my favorite is because the Chiefs are my favorite team. I also really enjoy the atmosphere, and
            getting to walk around all of the tailgates before the game.
